Tool for converting data from the CSV-file to XML and JSON formats.
Developed by Andrii Konoval for trivago GmbH as case-study.

Case-study was developed and tested on Ubuntu 15.04 x86-64.
So, I suppose the test of the app on Debian x86-64 is preferable.

To run the app, execute CaseStudyCliRunner.php in the terminal.
> php CaseStudyCliRunner.php

You can change the parameters of execution.
For this goal you should edit CaseStudyCliRunner.php file.
There is an array of parameters which you can edit according tips
in the file.

In case 'phpunit' installed you can run the unit tests:
> phpunit test
